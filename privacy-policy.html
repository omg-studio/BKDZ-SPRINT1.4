                          <section></section>

<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") governs the collection, use and sharing of Personal Information by KidZania Operations SARL, Luxembourg ("KidZania" or "We"), its affiliates and Operators of KidZania Franchises ("Operators") in connection with the KidZania Loyalty Program, B-KidZanian. B-KidZanian provides benefits and recognition across a spectrum of interactions with KidZania.</p>

<h2>Scope of Policy</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to Personal Information collected as part of the B-KidZanian program.  "Personal Information" refers to information that may be used to contact or identify an individual.  This may include, but is not limited to, first and last name; street address; email address; or other identifying information.  It also includes non-identifying information that may be stored with Personal Information.   
Information that does not identify a person, such as anonymous or aggregated data, is not covered by this Policy.  We may collect, use and disclose such information without limitation.</p>  
<h2>Personal Information Collection, Use and Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enrollment</strong><br>
<p><b>Collection</b>: We ask parents and guardians to provide the following information about their child at the point of enrollment: the child's first and last name; month and year of birth; country of birth; the KidZania location where the child's Passport is issued; and the child's email address (optional).  We also ask for your email address, mailing address, and/or telephone number. When your child's Passport is issued, we may take a photo of your child for the Passport. If you enroll online at <a href="http://www.bkidzanian.com/">www.BKidZanian.com</a>, you are asked to create a User ID, password and PIN for your account.</p>
<p><b>Use</b>:  This information is used to issue a Passport for use at KidZania locations.  Your child's Passport should be carefully safeguarded.  We also use this information to send you relevant notices, promotions, and other offers. We may store your child's photo to replace lost Passports or personalize your child's online experience.  Enrollment information may also be used to create an online account where you or your child may track progress in the program.</p>
<p><b>Sharing</b>:  KidZania shares enrollment information with our affiliates, Operators, and service providers in order to provide Program benefits (as described in Section II, below).  KidZania will not share your or your child's Personal Information with any other third party, except as described in this policy, without first obtaining your consent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>B-KidZanian provides a website where both you and your child can create linked online accounts where you can create and edit profiles; view summaries of Program status, benefits, and activities; and manage account information and communication preferences.</p>

<p><b>Collection</b>: To create an online account, parents must provide their first and last name, email address, a User ID, password and PIN.
